# getting-and-cleaning-data

This folder contains the class project homework for the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

In this folder there are 4 files.
1) run_analysis.R
2) code_book.txt
3) README.md
4) tidy_data_final.txt

The "run_analysis.R" contains the script that will process the data files contained
in the folder "~/R/UCI HAR Dataset" and finally write a file with the name "tidy_data_final.txt"
to the folder, which contains the final outcome of the codes.

The code_book.txt contains a description of all the variable names found in the "tidy_data_final.txt".

The "tidy_data_final.txt" has been uploaded to the course project page and here's an additional copy.
